## How to play

Avoid incoming bullets and strike down all enemies. At the title screen, you can select a game mode (CLASSIC, BASIC, MODERN).

- CLASSIC mode:
  - Sporadic firing.
  - Use a capture beam to make a friend of an enemy.
  - When your ship collides against an enemy, your ship is destroyed.
- BASIC mode:
  - Middle course.
  - You can use the capture beam anytime.
  - When your ship collides against an enemy, your ship is knocked away.
- MODERN mode:
  - Bullet hell.
  - Use a provocation beam to force an enemy to fire more bullets and earn a bullet multiplier bonus.
  - When your ship collides against an enemy, nothing happens. Your ship and an enemy go through each other.
